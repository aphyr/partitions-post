Wish I remembered where this guy worked, but after my RICON talk someone
indicated to me that their Mongo replica sets failed over on a *weekly*
basis--without node failures. This happened on real hardware, not EC2. That
suggests a partition to me--whether in the network or due to the mongo process
going unresponsive for minutes on end.
