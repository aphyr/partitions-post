"Almost all our servers are provided by Hetzner AG which operates multiple
datacenters in different parts of Germany."

"...our monitoring system started at about 10:10 UTC to alert us of network
packet loss levels of 50% to 100% with a number of servers and a lot of failing
service checks, which most of the times is a symptom of connectivity problems.
We recognized quickly that most of the servers with bad connectivity were
located in Hetzner datacenter #10."

Next day another outage, caused by a router firmware bug

"Unfortunately, the malfunctioning network had caused additional problems which
we became aware of in the afternoon when a customer called our support hotline
because their website failed to deliver certain image files. We found that this
was caused by a split-brain situation on the storage cluster “stor02″ where
changes made on node “stor02b” weren’t reflected on “stor02a” and the self-heal
algorithm built into the Gluster filesystem was not able to resolve this
inconsistency between the two data sets."

Resolving the inconsistency led to "brief overload of the web nodes because of
a short surge in network traffic."
