"PagerDuty’s infrastructure is hosted in three different datacenters (two in
AWS and another in Linode)"

"At 8:35am, PagerDuty completely loses its ability to dispatch notification, as
it couldn’t establish quorum due to high network latency. Sev-1 is declared. At
8:53am, PagerDuty notification dispatch system was able to reach quorum and
started to process all queued notifications"

18 minutes of downtime for a system explicitly designed for partition tolerance in mind. No data loss, though!
