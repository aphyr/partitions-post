"Prescient. The w=safe scenario you show (including extra fails during rollback/re-election) happened to us today when EC2 West region had network issues that caused a network partition that separated PRIMARY from its 2 SECONDARIES in a 3 node replset. 2 hours later the old primary rejoined and rolled back everything on the new primary. Our bad for not using w=majority."
