"Now we briefly describe the typical causes of outages
in our cells. If we assume (optimistically) that a cell is
“up” if it has a master that is willing to serve, on a sam-
ple of our cells we recorded 61 outages over a period of
a few weeks, amounting to 700 cell-days of data in to-
tal. We excluded outages due to maintenance that shut
down the data centre. All other causes are included: net-
work congestion, maintenance, overload, and errors due
to operators, software, and hardware. Most outages were
15s or less, and 52 were under 30s; most of our appli-
cations are not affected significantly by Chubby outages
under 30s. The remaining nine outages were caused by
network maintenance (4), suspected network connectiv-
ity problems (2), software errors (2), and overload (1)."
